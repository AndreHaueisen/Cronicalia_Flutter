            With the upcoming generation of cars, we are at the edge of a revolution. Electric cars promise to lower the level of air and sound pollution in the big cities by a substantial amount, and self-driving cars are expected to save millions of lives worldwide. Although the benefits are huge, there are still some challenges to overcome. Electric cars are not yet affordable by the big mass and autonomous vehicles were involved in accidents recently. We will walk through some advantages of these two core technologies and finish evaluating some of the biggest challenges they face today.
          It is well known that air pollution causes a lot of premature deaths worldwide and cars have a big share of responsibility. If you traveled by airplane to a big city, you probably know what I’m talking about. That grey, thick layer of pollution above the city right before the plane lands. “Electric vehicle technology has the advantage that it produces no air pollution at the point of use, so that if the electricity is generated in a distant place, electric cars are a means of switching the location of environmental discharges” (Lave, Hendrickson & McMichael, 1995, para. 2); the result is the pollution gone, taking us right into the future, a future not so distant where the cars we drive emit only friction noise. Automakers have already noticed the economic opportunity and companies like Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, and Ford are pushing forward to release battery-only cars in 2019 (“Race is On”, 2018, para. 3).
          Walking alongside electrics cars, there are the advances in artificial intelligence which are responsible for the astounding development of machines that drives themselves. How many times do you wake up in the morning only to hear about another fatal accident involving a drunken driver? People are not reliable drivers and make a lot of mistakes. Computers do not sleep, drink or text and will probably save your life one of these days.
          Let’s put those two technologies together and try to imagine how much would that car cost. The cheapest car on the horizon that is totally electric and has an autopilot will cost $35,000 (Shen, 2017, para. 1). This is way more expensive than today's mainstream cars. Autonomous cars also have its challenges too. Since the technology isn’t still perfect, there have been reports of fatal accidents, but since human negligence causes millions of deaths, one death from an autonomous vehicle can’t inhibit innovation (“Autonomous Car Death”, 2018, para. 4).
          Although today the electric self-driving car is not affordable for the mass population, and autonomous drivers are not yet safety proof, they will soon be and will, together, save millions of lives. The future is coming. Buckle up.
